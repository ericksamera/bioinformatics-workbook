# 3: Sanger Sequencing & ApE (AplasmidEditor)

{% hint style="info" %}
## Learning Objectives

### **3.1: APlasmidEditor (ApE) - Introduction and installation**

* [ ] Describe the function and purpose of AplasmidEditor software.
* [ ] Navigate the AplasmidEditor interface becoming familiar with some basic functions.
* [ ] Briefly explore using AplasmidEditor with plasmids and restriction enzymes.&#x20;



### **3.2: Exploring an electropherogram**

* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to open and view an electropherogram file.
* [ ] Identify the different components of an electropherogram, including the peaks, baseline, noise, and quality scores.
* [ ] Troubleshoot common issues that may arise when analyzing electropherograms using AplasmidEditor, such as signal saturation or background noise.



### **3.3: Pairwise alignments**

* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to perform pairwise sequence alignment of two DNA sequences.
* [ ] Interpret the alignment results to identify similarities and differences between the two sequences.
* [ ] Analyze the alignment output to identify potential mutations, insertions, and deletions in the sequences.
* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to verify heterozygous SNPs, false SNPs, and other artifacts of Sanger sequencing.



### **3.4: Annotations and the GenBank format**

* [ ] Define the concept of sequence annotation and its importance in understanding the genetic code.
* [ ] Understand the different types of genetic features that can be annotated, including genes, regulatory elements, and non-coding regions.
* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to annotate genetic features in DNA sequences, including adding labels, colors, and other annotations.



### **3.5: ORFS & translation**

* [ ] Recall the central dogma of molecular biology and the process of transcription and translation.
* [ ] Define open reading frames (ORFs) and their importance in identifying potential protein-coding regions in DNA sequences.
* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to identify ORFs in DNA sequences and understand the criteria for ORF prediction.
* [ ] Understand the different genetic codes and use AplasmidEditor to translate DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.
