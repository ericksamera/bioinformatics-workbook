## Background

The GenBank file format is a critical component of modern biological research, serving as a comprehensive repository of genetic sequence data. Developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), GenBank is a publicly accessible database that stores DNA and RNA sequences, annotations, and related information. This standardized format plays a pivotal role in facilitating data sharing, collaboration, and scientific discoveries in various fields such as genomics, evolutionary biology, and biotechnology. In this section, we will explore the structure and features of the GenBank file format, highlighting its significance in the realm of biological sciences.
