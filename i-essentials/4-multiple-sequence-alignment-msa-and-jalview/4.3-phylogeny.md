# 4.3: Phylogeny

{% hint style="info" %}
**Learning Objectives**

* [ ] Understand the fundamental concepts and terminologies used in phylogenetic analysis, such as branch lengths, evolutionary distance, and tree topology.
* [ ] Generate phylogenetic trees from the sequence alignment, using various methods such as neighbor-joining and average distance.
* [ ] Evaluate reliability of the phylogenetic tree using bootstrapping, posterior probabilities, or other methods.
* [ ] Interpret the phylogenetic tree topology and the branch lengths, identify the relationships among the sequences, and recognize the significance of any patterns or clusters observed in the tree.
