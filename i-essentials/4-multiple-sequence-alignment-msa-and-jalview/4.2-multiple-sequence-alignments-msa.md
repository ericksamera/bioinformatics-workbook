**Learning Objectives**

* [ ] Perform sequence alignment with Jalview using various alignment algorithms, and identify the strengths and limitations of each approach.
  * [ ] Muscle
  * [ ] Clustal
  * [ ] MAFFT
* [ ] Compare multiple sequence alignments with pairwise alignments and identify their purposes.
* [ ] Identify conserved regions conserved regions of the alignment and recognize their significance in sequence conservation.
