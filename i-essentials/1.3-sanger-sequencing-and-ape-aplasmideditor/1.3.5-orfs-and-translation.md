# 3.5: ORFs & translation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Learning Objectives**

* [ ] Recall the central dogma of molecular biology and the process of transcription and translation.
* [ ] Define open reading frames (ORFs) and their importance in identifying potential protein-coding regions in DNA sequences.
* [ ] Use AplasmidEditor to identify ORFs in DNA sequences and understand the criteria for ORF prediction.
* [ ] Understand the different genetic codes and use AplasmidEditor to translate DNA sequences into amino acid sequences.
