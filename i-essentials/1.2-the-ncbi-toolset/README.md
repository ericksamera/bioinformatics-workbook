## Learning Objectives

### 2.1: Retrieving sequences from NCBI

* [ ] Explore NCBI's Nucleotide database.
  * [ ] Use the search function for NCBI's nucleotide database.
  * [ ] Download FASTA and GenBank sequence data.
  * [ ] Construct an Advanced Search query to find more specific sequences.
* [ ] Explore the Assembly database.
* [ ] Explore the RefSeq database.
* [ ] Explore the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and BioProjects.
* [ ] Explore NCBI Datasets.



### **2.2: BLAST**

* [ ] Understand the basic principles behind alignments and sequence similarity search.&#x20;
* [ ] Perform a BLAST with the NCBI nucleotide database.
* [ ] Interpret the quality and reliability of BLAST results.
* [ ] Explore BLAST programs and their use-cases.
  * [ ] blastn
  * [ ] blastp
  * [ ] tblastn, blastx, tblastx



### **2.3: Primer-BLAST**

* [ ] Review the basics of PCR and considerations for primer design such as primer length, melting temperature, and GC content.
* [ ] Use Primer-BLAST to design primers that target a gene of interest.
* [ ] Use the specificity-checking&#x20;
* [ ] Consider some troubleshooting scenarios that can arise from primer design such as low efficiency or non-specific amplification.
