## Background

One of the most common tasks in our "bioinformatics" division is retrieving biological sequences of interest â€” whether it be genomic DNA sequences, mRNA transcripts, amino acids, or others.\
\
The largest repository of publicly available biological sequences is NCBI GenBank which is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. The database contains over **300 million** records including whole genomes, genes, transcripts, proteins, and more which are completely freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection.\
\
GenBank is split up into several databases, which can be accessed through the _Nucleotide_ database ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore)). NCBI also runs several other databases of interest, including Assembly (assembled genomes and other genomic sequencing data) and RefSeq (a curated collection of genomic DNA, transcript, and protein sequences with stable IDs).
