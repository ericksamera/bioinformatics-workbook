# Usage

## Pre-requisites

None! Well, I'd hope that maybe this would be for those that have completed at least BIOL2320 (2nd year genetics), but I will try to include sections for biological context where necessary.

## Recommended hardware

Also none! Well, hopefully. Most of the software in the AGC essentials can be run on almost any kind of computer. The NGS stuff will be slightly more involved.

## Multi-track drifting

I've designed this textbook to provide a comprehensive learning experience, but you don't need to complete every exercise to benefit from it. Rather, the book serves as a reference for honing specific skills and techniques relevant to specific projects. I'm hoping that with the sections and exercises, you can easily pinpoint the areas that best support your learning and career goals.
